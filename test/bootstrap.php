// Some systems (e.g. OSX) don't block on commands exec()ed in the below fashion. Other systems (e.g. Travis) do.
// Systems which do block need to have their output redirected from stdout/stderr if the command being exec()ed is
// long running.
// Also, some systems (e.g. OSX) fail the tests if the output of starting WireMock is redirected (possibly because
// they're running tests in parallel?), whereas others (e.g. Travis).
// So far, there's a 1-to-1 mapping between these kinds of systems, but it's unclear if that's just chance or not.
// For now, just check which kind of system we're on, so we know whether to redirect output or not.
